    Hello People! In this Repository I'm going to showcase you people my very first CLI app that 
    I have created with the guidance of our very own TANAY PRATAP Sir!

    Let's Start:-

    explain- creating a variable using "var" called readlinSync and then inserting in it require function
    of readline-sync (even before doing this we need to install readline-sync package by typing "npm install 
    readline-sync" in our repl's shell).
    //var readlineSync = require('readline-sync')
    
    explain- (INPUT)
    Then creating another variable called askUsername and storing "question" fucntion of readlinSync
    variable with "string" in bracket. And then using "console.log" to print string that we want. 
    //var askUserName = readlineSync.question("What is Your Name? ")
    //console.log("Welcome!", askUserName)

    explain- creating variable "score" and giving it input value 0, so that score of right answer can be 
    updated.
    //var score = 0

    explain- (INPUT)
    A variable is created named listOfQuestion wherein we have inserted a "list" by using [], and 
    "dict" by using {}, where "dict" has "question:" key and "answer:" key having different value. 
    //var listOfQuestion = [{
    //   question: "What is my name? ",
    //   answer: "Dev Bhati"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Where I was born? ",
    //   answer: "Kolkata"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Who is my favourite superhero? ",
    //   answer: "Batman"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Which song is my favourite song? ",
    //   answer: "Deva Deva"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Which is my favourite movie? ",
    //   answer: "Kantara"
    //  }]
    
    
    explain- (OUTPUT) 
    A function "play" has been created which has two parameters namely 
    quetsion: & answer: key then variable "userInput" has been created to ask "question", and than further the 
    "if and else" is used to print the answer accordingly.
    // function play(question, answer) {
    //   var userInput = readlineSync.question(question)

    //   if (userInput.toUpperCase() === answer.toUpperCase()) {
    //     console.log("You are right!")
    //     score = score + 1
    //     console.log("Your score is, ", score)
    //   } else {
    //     console.log("You are wrong!")
    //     score = score - 1
    //     console.log("Your score is, ", score)
    //   }
    // }


    explain- (PROCESS) "for" loop is generated to itirrate over question: & answer: key of listOfQuestion variable
    and than put it into askedQuestion variable and than by using play fucntion they are printed 
    // for (var i = 0; i < listOfQuestion.length; i++) {
    //   var askedQuestion = listOfQuestion[i]
    //   play(askedQuestion.question, askedQuestion.answer)
    // }

    
    explain- (OUTRO)
    //var highScore = {
    //   name: "Dev",
    //   score: 5
    //   }

    //console.log("Congratulation!, You Scored:", score)

    //console.log("Highest score is!", highScore.score,"by", highScore.name, 
    "If you have scored more than or equal to his score please send screenshot we'll update your name!")
