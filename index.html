    Hello People! In this Repository I'm going to showcase you people my very first CLI app that 
    I have created with the guidance of our very own TANAY PRATAP Sir!

    Let's Start:-

    //explain- creating a variable using "var" called readlinSync and then inserting in it require function
    of readline-sync (even before doing this we need to install readline-sync package by typing "npm install 
    readline-sync" in our repl's shell).
    //var readlineSync = require('readline-sync')
    
    //explain- Then creating another variable called askUsername and storing "question" fucntion of readlinSync
    variable with "string" in bracket. And then using "console.log" to print string that we want. 
    //var askUserName = readlineSync.question("What is Your Name? ")
    //console.log("Welcome!", askUserName)
</body>
