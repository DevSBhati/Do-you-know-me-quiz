    Hello People! In this Repository I'm going to showcase you people my very first CLI app that 
    I have created with the guidance of our very own TANAY PRATAP Sir!

    Let's Start:-

    explain- creating a variable using "var" called readlinSync and then inserting in it require function
    of readline-sync (even before doing this we need to install readline-sync package by typing "npm install 
    readline-sync" in our repl's shell).
    //var readlineSync = require('readline-sync')
    
    explain- Then creating another variable called askUsername and storing "question" fucntion of readlinSync
    variable with "string" in bracket. And then using "console.log" to print string that we want. 
    //var askUserName = readlineSync.question("What is Your Name? ")
    //console.log("Welcome!", askUserName)

    explain- creating variable "score" and giving it input value 0, so that score of right answer can be 
    updated.
    //var score = 0

    //var listOfQuestion = [{
    //   question: "What is my name? ",
    //   answer: "Dev Bhati"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Where I was born? ",
    //   answer: "Kolkata"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Who is my favourite superhero? ",
    //   answer: "Batman"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Which song is my favourite song? ",
    //   answer: "Deva Deva"
    //  }, {
    //   question: "Which is my favourite movie? ",
    //   answer: "Kantara"
    //  }]
</body>
